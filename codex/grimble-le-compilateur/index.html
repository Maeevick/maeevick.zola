I can recite by heart the exact location of the smallest grimoire, but I admit to sometimes forgetting the names of people I encounter daily <em>(in my defense, people change, books remain constant)</em>.<p>My classification system, though misunderstood by my peers, follows an internal logic of fascinating complexity and is the best that exists according to me. For example, I shelve demonology works next to gardening treatises because both deal with things that grow in dark places.<p><strong>Supposed flaws</strong> <em>(according to certain unfounded criticisms)</em>:<ul><li>Tendency to accord the same importance to a sock-alignment manual as to a grimoire of black magic <em>(democracy, no?)</em><li>Frequent distractions by insignificant details <em>(yet, as everyone knows, the devil is in the details)</em><li>Naivety in social interactions <em>(in my opinion, rather honesty...)</em></ul><hr><h2 id=history-genesis-of-an-archivist>History - Genesis of an Archivist</h2><p><strong>Modest origins</strong>: Born in the tunnels beneath the library, I grew up surrounded by discarded books that my fellow goblins used as fuel. From my earliest age, I felt a mystical connection with these abandoned pages. <em>(Note for later: perhaps the books chose me as much as I chose them? worth pondering)</em><p><strong>Professional ascension</strong>: My official hiring resulted from a fortuitous misunderstanding: surprised by a magician while properly arranging fallen volumes, I was taken for a model employee rather than a compulsive organizational intruder. <em>(Mental note: having never dared clarify the situation, I now consider this position my divine callingâ€”might I be Grhubt's chosen one?)</em><p><strong>Self-proclaimed mission</strong>: I have assigned myself the noble task of compiling the "Codex of Chaos," a monumental work destined to gather all knowledge that is neglected, misclassified, or simply ignored by conventional scholars. <em>(This will be the <strong>biggest</strong> book that has never existed, literally)</em><hr><p><strong>Concluding Reflections</strong><p>The study of my own person reveals a fascinating paradox: the more I organize external chaos, the more I discover the internal chaos of my own mind. This contradiction doesn't bother me at all; it simply convinces me that I'm on the right path to understanding the universe's true order.<p><em>"True humility consists of recognizing that one never knows enough, while stubbornly continuing to classify everything anyway."</em><hr><p><strong>Personal archives compiled after 7 months of immersion with the subject</strong><p><em>Grimbleshanks Mortimer Quill</em><br> <em>Archivist of Neglected Knowledge and Assistant Deputy Custodian of the Great Library of Cogsburg</em></div></article></main><footer><p>Â© 2025 Maeevick - <a href=https://github.com/Maeevick/maeevick.zola target=_blank>GitHub</a> | <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/aurel-estoup/ target=_blank>LinkedIn</a> | <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/maeevick.bsky.social target=_blank>BlueSky</a></footer>
