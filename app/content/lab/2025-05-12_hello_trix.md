Greetings, future test subjects... I mean, **visitors**! Trix here, and I've _finally_ managed to create a space where I can experiment without Academy administrators confiscating my notes _(again)_ or judging my reagents _(which are perfect, unlike their opinions)_. They really took that whole "small controlled fire" in the library thing badly. Pfft, as if millennial manuscripts and exothermic reactions can't coexist!

## The GRAND Plan!

This arcano-technological portal (which the uninitiated call a "website") will serve to **document my discoveries** and occasionally those of Grimble _(but that's another dusty story, like his grimoires)_.

Here's what I plan to put here:

1. **My technical experiments** with things like Rust, Bevy and anything that might potentially explode that I know a little, a lot, passionately (JS/TS, Python, Haskell, Elixir) or not at all (not yet).
2. **Observations on software architecture and all that jazz** - because building code castles is like assembling magical mechanisms, but with fewer nuts and often more bugs. Hexagonal or Octagonal Architecture, understanding the DDD theorem (Division of Diagonals in a Decagon), implementing TDD (Thing-Driven Development now that everyone's inventing their own)...
3. **Accounts of my spectacular failures** - BELIEVE ME, there are enough to fill several volumes (99%)...

For this portal, I'm discovering and testing [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator coded in Rust that reminds me of my dear [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).
First challenge, I managed to get a perfect score on Lighthouse by optimizing the site's performance _(it wasn't that difficult, the harder part will be maintaining that 99+)_!
I mean, if I can calibrate ether catalysts with 0.003% precision to send void to the Moon, I can surely optimize a few CSS files, right?

## Under Construction!

_[This section is slightly charred but still legible]_

The site is still under construction, so some sections ~may seem~ are empty or unfinished. This is completely normal and absolutely not a sign of my crass procrastination or my stubborn lack of perseverance. It happens! Coming soon...

I'm currently working on a small game with the Bevy engine that will be integrated directly on the home page (the arcade machine in the corner of the bar that everyone's waiting for).
Imagine a goblin (who strangely resembles Grimble) avoiding obstacles (which strangely resemble my prototypes). It's going to be SPECTACULAR (but very simple so don't get too fired up)!

### Technical details for the curious

I'm trying not to use JS for now (the burger menu is full CSS) ðŸŽ‰ Why? Because...

Well, I have to go - I think my latest experiment is starting to melt the workbench. See you soon for new adventures!
