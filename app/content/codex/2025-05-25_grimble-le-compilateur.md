_According to my meticulous observations (and perfectly objective ones, naturally), it is fitting to archive my own characteristics for posterity and the advancement of goblin science._

## Observations - Specimen Under Study: Myself

**Taxonomic classification**: _Gobellus bibliothecarius_  
**Age**: 40 years _(in the prime of life for a goblin, contrary to popular belief)_  
**Natural habitat**: Basements and dusty corners of the Great Arcane Library of Cogsburg

**Notable physical characteristics**:

- Modest stature, slightly leaning forward _(I would say average height, driven by attention to detail)_
- Glasses cobbled together from broken magnifying lenses _(Note to self: questionable efficiency but undeniable sentimental attachment)_
- Fingers constantly stained with various colored inks, a consequence of my innovative classification system

**Behavioral peculiarities**:

- Compulsive tic of adjusting glasses and tendency to look at shelves during complex social situations _(roughly 97.3% of the time)_
- Systematic finger-licking before turning a page, even in the absence of books _(professional habit, perfectly logical)_
- Tendency to interpret metaphorical expressions literally _(which avoids many misunderstandings, contrary to what my detractors claim)_

## Psychological Analysis - Portrait of a Methodical Mind

**Evident qualities**:
My photographic memory for texts constitutes my major asset. I can recite by heart the exact location of the smallest grimoire, but I admit to sometimes forgetting the names of people I encounter daily _(in my defense, people change, books remain constant)_.

My classification system, though misunderstood by my peers, follows an internal logic of fascinating complexity and is the best that exists according to me. For example, I shelve demonology works next to gardening treatises because both deal with things that grow in dark places.

**Supposed flaws** _(according to certain unfounded criticisms)_:

- Tendency to accord the same importance to a sock-alignment manual as to a grimoire of black magic _(democracy, no?)_
- Frequent distractions by insignificant details _(yet, as everyone knows, the devil is in the details)_
- Naivety in social interactions _(in my opinion, rather honesty...)_

## History - Genesis of an Archivist

**Modest origins**:
Born in the tunnels beneath the library, I grew up surrounded by discarded books that my fellow goblins used as fuel. From my earliest age, I felt a mystical connection with these abandoned pages. _(Note for later: perhaps the books chose me as much as I chose them? worth pondering)_

**Professional ascension**:
My official hiring resulted from a fortuitous misunderstanding: surprised by a magician while properly arranging fallen volumes, I was taken for a model employee rather than a compulsive organizational intruder. _(Mental note: having never dared clarify the situation, I now consider this position my divine callingâ€”might I be Grhubt's chosen one?)_

**Self-proclaimed mission**:
I have assigned myself the noble task of compiling the "Codex of Chaos," a monumental work destined to gather all knowledge that is neglected, misclassified, or simply ignored by conventional scholars. _(This will be the **biggest** book that has never existed, literally)_

**Concluding Reflections**

The study of my own person reveals a fascinating paradox: the more I organize external chaos, the more I discover the internal chaos of my own mind. This contradiction doesn't bother me at all; it simply convinces me that I'm on the right path to understanding the universe's true order.

_"True humility consists of recognizing that one never knows enough, while stubbornly continuing to classify everything anyway."_
