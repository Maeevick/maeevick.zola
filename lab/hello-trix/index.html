Well, probably not.]</em><p>Greetings, future test subjects... I mean, <strong>visitors</strong>! Trix here, and I've <em>finally</em> managed to create a space where I can experiment without Academy administrators confiscating my notes <em>(again)</em> or judging my reagents <em>(which are perfect, unlike their opinions)</em>. They really took that whole "small controlled fire" in the library thing badly. Pfft, as if millennial manuscripts and exothermic reactions can't coexist!<h2 id=the-grand-plan>The GRAND Plan!</h2><p>This arcano-technological portal (which the uninitiated call a "website") will serve to <strong>document my discoveries</strong> and occasionally those of Grimble <em>(but that's another dusty story, like his grimoires)</em>.<p>Here's what I plan to put here:<ol><li><strong>My technical experiments</strong> with things like Rust, Bevy and anything that might potentially explode that I know a little, a lot, passionately (JS/TS, Python, Haskell, Elixir) or not at all (not yet).<li><strong>Observations on software architecture and all that jazz</strong> - because building code castles is like assembling magical mechanisms, but with fewer nuts and often more bugs. Hexagonal or Octagonal Architecture, understanding the DDD theorem (Division of Diagonals in a Decagon), implementing TDD (Thing-Driven Development now that everyone's inventing their own)...<li><strong>Accounts of my spectacular failures</strong> - BELIEVE ME, there are enough to fill several volumes (99%)...</ol><p>For this portal, I'm discovering and testing <a href=https://www.getzola.org/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Zola</a>, a static site generator coded in Rust that reminds me of my dear <a href=https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hakyll</a>. First challenge, I managed to get a perfect score on Lighthouse by optimizing the site's performance <em>(it wasn't that difficult, the harder part will be maintaining that 99+)</em>! I mean, if I can calibrate ether catalysts with 0.003% precision to send void to the Moon, I can surely optimize a few CSS files, right?<h2 id=under-construction>Under Construction!</h2><p><em>[This section is slightly charred but still legible]</em><p>The site is still under construction, so some sections <del>may seem</del> are empty or unfinished. This is completely normal and absolutely not a sign of my crass procrastination or my stubborn lack of perseverance. It happens! Coming soon...<p>I'm currently working on a small game with the Bevy engine that will be integrated directly on the home page (the arcade machine in the corner of the bar that everyone's waiting for). Imagine a goblin (who strangely resembles Grimble) avoiding obstacles (which strangely resemble my prototypes). It's going to be SPECTACULAR (but very simple so don't get too fired up)!<h3 id=technical-details-for-the-curious>Technical details for the curious</h3><p>I'm trying not to use JS for now (the burger menu is full CSS) ðŸŽ‰ Why? Because...<p>Well, I have to go - I think my latest experiment is starting to melt the workbench. See you soon for new adventures!<p><em>[A series of illegible runic symbols is scribbled at the bottom of the page, accompanied by a small purple stain that seems to glow faintly in the dark.]</em><p>~ Trix ðŸ§ªðŸ’¥</div></article></main><footer><p>Â© 2025 Maeevick - <a href=https://github.com/Maeevick/maeevick.zola target=_blank>GitHub</a> | <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/aurel-estoup/ target=_blank>LinkedIn</a> | <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/maeevick.bsky.social target=_blank>BlueSky</a></footer>
