# üöß WORK IN PROGRESS üöß website rework https://www.maeevick.com

Welcome to the repository of my personal creative hub! This project aims to build a unique fantasy-steampunk universe and aesthetics, my universe and hobby, with technical experiments, game development and creative writing.

## TL;DR

The website is structured around four main sections:

- **The Tavern** - Home page and general purpose stuff
- **The Quests** - Games and software products/projects
- **The Codex of Chaos** - Lore, stories and universe building
- **The Trix's Lab** - Technical experiments and blog posts (almost failures, I swear!)

This repository contains both the technical implementation of the website and its creative content, each under different licenses.

## üß™ Trix's Lab (Tech Corner of this Website)

_"Welcome to my lab, fellow tinkerers! This is where I experiment with arcano-technological contraptions powering this very pocket of the ethereal plane you're currently visiting. Some call it 'web development' ‚Äî I call it 'practical dimensional engineering with minimal explosions!'_

_As any proper apprentice knows, documenting your experiments is crucial ‚Äî especially the failures. Perhaps EVEN MORE the failures! So here's my ever-expanding catalog of tools and techniques I'm employing in this grand experiment."_

### üîß Current Tech Stack Checklist

####

- [x] **Zola** - Static site generator crafted in Rust (v0.20.0) - _"A marvelously efficient contraption that transmutes my markdown scribblings into browser-compatible enchantments! And, as almost all rust-based tools, it rarely explodes, which is always cool."_

### Future Enhancements

_"This is merely the beginning of our arcano-technological journey! I've got plans for integrating HTMX enchantments, WebAssembly constructs, and possibly some mechanical automations with Actix-web... assuming my workshop doesn't catch fire again. For more detailed schematics and technical grimoires about how this site functions, check out my experiment logs [Coming Soon...]_

## License

This project uses a dual licensing approach to separate the technical implementation from the creative content.

### Software and Technical Components

All code, templates, configuration files, and technical documentation are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

This means you are free to:

- Use the technical implementation for any purpose, including commercial
- Modify, adapt, and build upon the codebase
- Distribute your modifications under any license of your choice

### Creative Content

All creative content including but not limited to texts, stories, character descriptions, universe lore, artwork, and images are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](LICENSE).

### Practical Examples

To clarify the dual licensing:

‚úÖ **You can**:

- Use the Zola templates, HTMX implementation, and CSS structure for your own projects
- Fork the repository to create your own website with similar technical capabilities
- Create fan fiction or derivative works based on the universe, if proper attribution is given and it's not commercial

‚ùå **You cannot**:

- Use the characters Trix or Grimble in a commercial project without permission
- Republish the Codex of Chaos content verbatim without attribution
- Create commercial works based on the creative content
