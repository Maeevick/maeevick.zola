## License

This project uses a dual licensing approach to separate the technical implementation from the creative content.

### Software and Technical Components

All code, templates, configuration files, and technical documentation are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

This means you are free to:

- Use the technical implementation for any purpose, including commercial
- Modify, adapt, and build upon the codebase
- Distribute your modifications under any license of your choice

### Creative Content

All creative content including but not limited to texts, stories, character descriptions, universe lore, artwork, and images are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](LICENSE).

For more details, see the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license summary.

### Practical Examples

To clarify the dual licensing:

‚úÖ **You can**:

- Use the Zola templates, HTMX implementation, and CSS structure for your own projects
- Fork the repository to create your own website with similar technical capabilities
- Create fan fiction or derivative works based on the universe, if proper attribution is given and it's not commercial

‚ùå **You cannot**:

- Use the characters Trix or Grimble in a commercial project without permission
- Republish the Codex of Chaos content verbatim without attribution
- Create commercial works based on the creative content
